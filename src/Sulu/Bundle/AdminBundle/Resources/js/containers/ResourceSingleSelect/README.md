This component uses the [`SingleSelect` component](#singleselect) and attaches it to one of the registered
resources. The component will then load the resources with the given `resourceKey`. There are two properties describing
which properties of the fields are used, the `displayProperty` describes which property from the object is read to the 
input field and the `idProperty` defines which property is used as value.
