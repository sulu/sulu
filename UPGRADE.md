# Upgrade

## dev-develop

### Removed symfony/security-acl dependency

The following deprecated classes was removed:

* `Sulu\Component\Security\Authorization\AccessControl\PermissionMap`
* `Sulu\Component\Security\Authorization\AccessControl\SymfonyAccessControlManager`

Therefor the dependency `symfony/security-acl` was useless and removed.

## 1.5.0-RC1

### Media formats uniqueness

The uniqueness of media formats is now checked, and an exception is thrown in
case duplicated format keys exist.

In addition to that the existing formats have been prefixed with `sulu-`,
so that they are less likely to conflict. If you have relied on these formats,
which you shouldn't have, then you have to create them now in your own theme.

The following formats do not exist anymore, and should therefore be deleted
from the `web/uploads/media`-folder, except you decide to create the image
format on your own:

* 400x400
* 400x400-inset
* 260x
* 170x170
* 100x100
* 100x100-inset
* 50x50

### Page author

The page has a new property `author` and `authored` which will be prefilled
with values from `creator`/`created`.

If you have used one of these names before for some properties in your page or
snippet templates, then you have to change the name. Rename the field in the
XML definition and in the twig template, and execute the following command with
the filled in placeholders wrapped in `<>`:

```
app/console doctrine:phpcr:nodes:update --query "SELECT * FROM [nt:base] AS n WHERE [i18n:<localization>-author] IS NOT NULL AND ISDESCENDANTNODE(n, '/cmf')" --apply-closure="\$node->setProperty('i18n:<localization>-<new-field-name>', \$node->getPropertyValue('i18n:<localization>-author')); \$node->getProperty('i18n:<localization>-author')->remove();"
```

This command should be executed for every registered localization and for both
sessions (once without parameter and once with `--session=live`).

Afterwards you can safely migrate the data to use `creator` and `created` as
start values for `author` and `authored`.

```
app/console phpcr:migrations:migrate
```

### Twig 2

If you upgrade twig to version 2 please read follow
[this instructions](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/1.x/deprecated.html).

The most important change is ``_self`` for calling macros. You have to import it before using.

__Before:__
```twig
{ _self.macro_name() }}
```

__After:__
```twig
{% import _self as self %}
{ self.macro_name() }}
```

If you dont want to use twig2 please add following line to your ``composer.json``:

```json
"require": {
    ...
    "twig/twig": "^1.11"
}
```

### Deprecations

Following classes and methods were removed because of deprecations:

* Sulu\Component\Security\Authorization\AccessControl\SymfonyAccessControlVoter
* Sulu\Component\Rest\RestController::responsePersistSettings
* Sulu\Component\Rest\RestController::responseList
* Sulu\Component\Rest\RestController::createHalResponse
* Sulu\Component\Rest\RestController::getHalLinks
* Sulu\Bundle\WebsiteBundle\DefaultController::redirectAction
* Sulu\Bundle\WebsiteBundle\DefaultController::redirectWebspaceAction

Additionally the GeneratorBundle was removed because it was not maintained since a while.
You have to remove the Bundle from you Kernels.

## 1.4.3

### Multiple properties in template

There was a bug in the template definition for the `minOccurs` field. It was
not working if the `minOccurs` field had a value of `1`. So if you have a field
like the following and you don't want it to be a multiple field you have to
remove the `minOccurs` property:

```xml
    <property name="test1" type="text_line" minOccurs="2"></property>
```

### Format cache

To generate the correct file extension the `FormatManager::purge` interface
has changed.

```diff
-    public function purge($idMedia, $fileName, $options)
+    public function purge($idMedia, $fileName, $mimeType, $options)
```

## 1.4.2

### Security Context

The length of the security context was rather short (only 60 character). The
length has been increased to 255 characters, to also allow longer webspace
names. Execute the `doctrine:schema:update --force` command to update the
database schema.

### Webspace keys

Webspace keys are only allowed to have lower case letters, numbers and `-` or
`_`. Other characters might cause problems and are therefore already restricted
in the XSD file. If you have other characters you have to rename your webspace.

In case you have to you also must rename the `/cmf/<webspace>` e.g. using the
PHPCR shell and reconfigure your role permissions. You should also clear the
search index with the `massive:search:purge` command and reindex with the
`massive:search:reindex` command.

## 1.4.0

### Ports in webspace config

From now on the the port has to be a part of the URL in the webspace
configuration. So if you are running your website on a different port than the
default port of the protocol you are using, you have to change the webspace
config. The port must still be omitted when the `{host}` placeholder is used.

## 1.4.0-RC2

### Admin User Settings

The method `sulu.loadUserSetting()` was removed from the Sulu Aura.js extension located in `Sulu/Bundle/AdminBundle/Resources/public/js/aura_extensions/sulu-extension.js`. 
Instead the method `sulu.getUserSetting()` should be used, which provides same functionality, but is called differently (no need to provide neither URL nor callback in addition to the key).

 
### Media StorageInterface

The `StorageInterface` in the `Sulu\Bundle\MediaBundle\Media\Storage` namespace
got a new `loadAsString` method, which should return the file for the given
parameters as a binary string. If you have already developed your own storage
implementation you have to add this method.

### Page-Templates

The cache-lifetime of page-templates was extended by the `type` attribute.
This attribute is optional and default set to seconds which behaves like
before and set the `max-age` to given integer.

There is now a second type `expression` which allows you to define the
lifetime with a cron-expression which enhances the developer to define
that a page has to be invalidated at a specific time of the day (or
whatever you need).

__BEFORE:__
```xml
<template xmlns="http://schemas.sulu.io/template/template"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://schemas.sulu.io/template/template http://schemas.sulu.io/template/template-1.0.xsd">

    <key>template</key>

    <view>page.html.twig</view>
    <controller>SuluContentBundle:Default:index</controller>
    <cacheLifetime>2400</cacheLifetime>
    
    ...
    
</template>
```

__NOW:__
```xml
<template xmlns="http://schemas.sulu.io/template/template"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://schemas.sulu.io/template/template http://schemas.sulu.io/template/template-1.0.xsd">

    <key>template</key>

    <view>page.html.twig</view>
    <controller>SuluContentBundle:Default:index</controller>

    <!-- releases cache each day at midnight -->
    <cacheLifetime type="expression">@daily</cacheLifetime>
    
    ...
    
</template>
```

Therefor we changed the type of the return value for `Sulu\Component\Content\Compat\StructureInterface::getCacheLifeTime`
to array. This array contains the `type` and the `value` of the configured
cache-lifetime.

For resolving this array to a concrete second value we introduced the service
`sulu_http_cache.cache_lifetime.resolver` there you can call the `resolve`
function which returns the concrete second value.

## 1.4.0-RC1

### Refactored category management in backend

The backend of the category bundle was refactored and the category related entities were implemented extensible.
This lead to the following changes:

**API:**
`/categories`: renamed parameter `parent` which accepted an id to `rootKey` which accepts a key
`/categories/{key}/children` was replaced with `/categories/{id}/children`

**Classes:**
`Category\CategoryRepositoryInterface` moved to `Entity\CategoryRepositoryInterface` 
`Category\KeywordRepositoryInterface` moved to `Entity\KeywordRepositoryInterface`
`Category\Exception\KeywordIsMultipleReferencedException` moved to `Exception\KeywordIsMultipleReferencedException` 
`Category\Exception\KeywordNotUniqueException` moved to `Exception\KeywordNotUniqueException` 
`Category\Exception\KeyNotUniqueException` was replaced with `Exception\CategoryKeyNotUniqueException` 

**Methods:**
Removed: `Api\Category::setName($name)`
Replacement: `Api\Category::setTranslation(CategoryTranslationInterface $translation)`
Reason: The api-entity cannot create a translation-entity as the translation-entity is implemented extensible.

Removed: `Api\Category::setMeta($metaArrays)`
Replacement: `Api\Category::setMeta($metaEntities)`
Reason: The api-entity cannot create a meta-entity as the meta-entity is implemented extensible.

Deprecated: `CategoryRepositoryInterface::findCategoryByIds(array $ids)`
Replacement: `CategoryRepositoryInterface::findCategoriesByIds(array $ids)`

Deprecated: `CategoryRepositoryInterface::findCategories($parent = null, $depth = null, $sortBy = null, $sortOrder = null)`
Replacement: `CategoryRepositoryInterface::findChildrenCategoriesByParentId($parentId = null)`

Deprecated: `CategoryRepositoryInterface::findChildren($key, $sortBy = null, $sortOrder = null)`
Replacement: `CategoryRepositoryInterface::findChildrenCategoriesByParentKey($parentKey = null)`

Deprecated: `CategoryManagerInterface::find($parent = null, $depth = null, $sortBy = null, $sortOrder = null)`
Replacement: `CategoryManagerInterface::findChildrenByParentId($parentId = null)`

Deprecated: `CategoryManagerInterface::findChildren($key, $sortBy = null, $sortOrder = null)`
Replacement: `CategoryManagerInterface::findChildrenByParentKey($parentKey = null)`

**Container Parameters/Definitions:**
Deprecated: `sulu_category.entity.category` 
Replacement: `sulu.model.category.class` 

Deprecated: `sulu_category.entity.keyword`
Replacement: `sulu.model.keyword.class`

Deprecated: `sulu_category.category_repository`
Replacement: `sulu.repository.category`

Deprecated: `sulu_category.keyword_repository`
Replacement: `sulu.repository.keyword`

**Extensibility**
Every association of the `Category` entity must be of the type `CategoryInterface` to ensure extensibility
Every association of the `CategoryTranslation` entity must be of the type `CategoryTranslationInterface` to ensure extensibility
Every association of the `CategoryMeta` entity must be of the type `CategoryMetaInterface` to ensure extensibility
Every association of the `Keyword` entity must be of the type `KeywordInterface` to ensure extensibility

### New definition mechanism for image-formats

A new structure for the image-formats configuration files was introduced.
For an explanation on how to define image-formats in the new way please
refer to the documentation (http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/book/image-formats.html).

Out of the box, image-formats defined in the old way do still work,
but the `XMLLoader` and commands are marked as deprecated.
However when using more profound functionality regarding the image-formats,
there are some BC breaks:

#### `sulu_media.image_format_file` changed to `sulu_media.image_format_files`
The configuration `sulu_media.image_format_file` of the MediaBundle
was changed to `sulu_media.image_format_files` and the type was changed
from a scalar to an array.

#### "Command" renamed to "Transformation"
Internally the concept of a command on an image was renamed to 
"transformation". This renaming was consequently executed throughout the
MediaBundle. This BC break is only important when custom commands have
been created. To update the custom commands (now transformations) they now have
to implement the `TransformationInterface` instead of the `CommandInterface`.
Moreover the service tag under which a transformation gets registered changed
from `sulu_media.image.command` to `sulu_media.image.transformation`. The namespaces
containing "Command" were changed to contain "Transformation" instead.
Note that there was a slight change in the `TransformationInterface` itself.
The `execute` method has to return an image and the passed parameter is not
a reference anymore.

#### Array structure of `sulu_media.image.formats`
The structure of the arrays in which the formats are stored under
the symfony parameter `sulu_media.image.formats` changed. `name` was
renamed to `key`, `commands` was renamed to `transformation` and consequently
`command` to `transformation.`. In addition the first `scale` or `resize` command
is now not contained in the `commands` array anymore, but represented by the `scale`
sub-array of the format.

### ListRestHelper

The `ListRestHelper` has changed its constructor, it takes the `RequestStack`
instead of a `Request` now.

### RouteGenerator

The configuration for the route-generator has changed:

**Before:**
```
sulu_route:
    mappings:
        AppBundle\Entity\Example:
            route_schema: /example/{object.getTitle()}
```

**After:**
```
sulu_route:
    mappings:
        AppBundle\Entity\Example:
            generator: schema
            options:
                route_schema: /example/{object.getTitle()}
```

### Data-Navigation

The class `DataNavigationItem` got removed and is not supported
anymore. Please use other forms of navigating instead.

## 1.3.1

If Sulu is used in combination with a port, the port has to be included in the
URLs of the webspace configuration. So if you want to use Sulu on port 8080 the
configuration has to look like this:

```xml
<url>sulu.lo:8080/{localization}</url>
```

The port can still be emitted if the standard HTTP or HTTPS port is used.

## 1.3.0-RC3

### Resource-locator generation

The `generate` method of the `RlpStrategyInterface` uses `parentUuid` instead of `parentPath` now.
The signature changed from
`public function generate($title, $parentPath, $webspaceKey, $languageCode, $segmentKey = null);`
to
`public function generate($title, $parentUuid, $webspaceKey, $languageCode, $segmentKey = null);`

Also the `generateForUuid` method of the `RlpStrategyInterface` got removed.

### 190x Image Format

The image format "190x" got removed as it was only used in and old
design. If this format is needed for a website please redefine it
in the corresponding config file.

### Address country is nullable

To make it easier to migrate data the country in the address entity is now nullable in sulu.

```sql
ALTER TABLE co_addresses CHANGE idCountries idCountries INT DEFAULT NULL;
```

### Databases

#### ORM

The mapping structure of analytic settings have changed.
Use the following command to update:

```bash
app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

## 1.3.0-RC2

### RestController locale

The `getLocale` method of the RestController returned the locale
of the user (a system locale), if no request parameter with the name
`locale` was passed. As RestControllers most often provide access
to content in content locales and not in system locales,
this behaviour was removed. The `getLocale` method now just returns
a possibly passed request parameter named `locale` or null.
If a locale is needed for sure, the `getLocale` method needs to be
overwritten. It is also advised to override the method, if in no
case locales are needed.

### SearchController

The `SearchController` has been moved from sulu-standard to sulu. Therefore the
new template type `search` has been introduced. Just define the twig template
you want to use for the search in your webspace configuration:

```xml
<templates>
    <template type="search">ClientWebsiteBundle:views:query.html.twig</template>
</templates>
```

The name of the route also changed from `website_search` to
`sulu_search.website_search`, because the controller is located in the
SuluSearchBundle now.

### Removed HTTP Cache Paths-Handler

The HTTP Cache Integration has been refactored. The following configuration
is not available anymore and must be removed: `sulu_http_cache.handlers.paths`

### Webspace Configuration

The configuration schema for webspaces has changed. Instead of
`error-templates` you have to define `templates` now with a certain type.
For the error templates this type is `error` for the default error, and
`error-<code>` for certain error codes.

Before:
```xml
<error-templates>
    <error-template code="404">SomeBundle:view:error404.html.twig</error-template>
    <error-template default="true">SomeBundle:view:error.html.twig</error-template>
</error-templates>
```

After:
```xml
<templates>
    <template type="error-404">SomeBundle:views:error404.html.twig</template>
    <template type="error">SomeBundle:views:error.html.twig</template>
</templates>
```

And the `resource-locator` node has moved from `portal` to `webspace`. 

This change only affects the files which use the 1.1 version of the webspace
schema definition.

## 1.3.0-RC1

### Image Formats
The image format "150x100" as well as the format "200x200" got removed
from the backend formats. If a website relied on this format,
it should be - as all image formats a website needs - defined
in the theme specific config file.
(http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/book/creating-a-basic-website/configuring-image-formats.html)

### PHPCR
To adapt to the new PHPCR structure execute the migrations:

```
app/console phpcr:migrations:migrate
```

### Media selection overlay
The frontend component 'media-selection-overlay@sulumedia' got removed,
please use 'media-selection/overlay@sulumedia' instead.

### NodeRepository

The `orderBefore` method of the `NodeRepository` has been removed. Use the
`reorder` method of the `DocumentManager` instead.

### LocalizationProvider
The core LocalizationProvider (which provided the system locales)
got removed. At this point the WebspaceLocalizationProvider is the
only LocalizationProvider in Sulu. If the system locales 
(locales in which translations for the admin panel are available) are
needed, please refer directly to the config `sulu_core.translations`.

### Translations
The command `sulu:translate:import` got removed, as the export command
(`sulu:translate:export`) now takes its translations directly from
the translation files and not from the database anymore. This change
would only cause conflicts, if one had a dependency directly on the
translations in the database. If so, please use the files in the
`Resources` folders.

### Publishing

For the publishing a separate workspace was introduced. This workspace
will be created and correctly filled by the PHPCR migrations.

Because the search index is now split into draft and live pages you have
to reindex all the content:

```bash
app/console massive:search:purge --all
app/console massive:search:reindex
app/webconsole massive:search:reindex
```

Also the `persist` call of the `DocumentManager` changed it behavior.
After persisting a document it will not be available on the website
immediately. Instead you also need to call `publish` with the same
document and locale.

### PHPCR Sessions

The sessions for PHPCR were configured at `sulu_core.phpcr` in the
configuration. This happens now at `sulu_document_manager.sessions`. You can
define multiple sessions here using different names and refer to one of them as
default session using the `sulu_document_manager.default_session` and to
another as live session using the `sulu_document_manager.live_session`.

### Documemt Manager Initializer

The `initialize` method of the `InitializerInterface` has now also a `$purge`
parameter, which tells the initializer if it should purge something. The
Initializer can use this information or simply ignore it, but existing
Initializers have to adapt to the new interface.

### Twig variable `request.routeParameters` removed

The `request.routeParameters` variable has been removed because it is not longer required when generate an url.

**Before**

```twig
{{ path('client_website.search', request.routeParameters) }}
```

**After**

```twig
{{ path('client_website.search') }}
```

### TitleBehavior is not localized anymore

If you have implemented your own Documents with an `TitleBehavior`,
you will recognize that the title in PHPCR is not translated anymore.
If you still want this Behavior you have to switch to the
`LocalizedTitleBehavior`.

### Indexing title of pages for search

It was possible to define that the title field of a page should be
indexed as title, although this value was already the default:

```
<property name="title" type="text_line" mandatory="true">
    <meta>
        <title lang="en">Title</title>
    </meta>
    <tag name="sulu.search.field" type="string" role="title" />
</property>
 ```

 This setting does not work anymore, because the title is now handled
 separately from the rest of the structure, and the title is not indexed
 anymore with this tag. Just remove it, and it will be the same as
 before.

### Webspaces

We have deprecated (1.0) the schema for webspaces and created a new version (1.1) of it. 

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<webspace xmlns="http://schemas.sulu.io/webspace/webspace"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://schemas.sulu.io/webspace/webspace http://schemas.sulu.io/webspace/webspace-1.1.xsd">
          
          ...
          
</webspace>
```

You should update your webspace.xml files soonish. To do that you simply have to move the `default-templates` and
`error-templates` from the `theme` node and put it into the `webspace` node after the `theme`.
 
The theme is now optional and can be used with a theme-bundle. Sulu has extracted this functionality to make it
replaceable with any theming bundle you want. To keep the old directory-structure and functionality please read the
next part of this file.

### Theming

If you have multiple themes (or you don't want to change the folder structure of you project) you have to include the
bundle https://github.com/sulu/SuluThemeBundle in your abstract kernel.

This bundle contains all the code which is necessary to use theming in your application.

### Configuration

The configuration of `sulu_content.preview` and `sulu_website.preview_defaults` has been moved to:

```
$ app/console config:dump-reference sulu_preview
# Default configuration for extension with alias: "sulu_preview"
sulu_preview:
    defaults:
        analytics_key:        UA-SULU-PREVIEW-KEY
    error_template:       ~ # Example: ClientWebsiteBundle:Preview:error.html.twig
    mode:                 auto

    # Used for the delayed send of changes
    delay:                500
```

The flag `sulu_content.preview.websocket` has been replaced with `sulu_websocket.enabled`. This flag is
now default `false`.

### Content-Types

The Interface or content-types has been cleaned. The function `ContentTypeInterface::readForPreview` will never
be called in the future and can therefor be removed.

## 1.2.7

### Default Country

The default country for addresses in the ContactBundle is set by the ISO 3166 country-code
instead the of database-id now.

## 1.2.4

### ContactRepository

A Interface for the ContactRepository has been created. Due to the refactoring
the function `appendJoins` has been changed from public to protected.
Therefore this function cannot be called anymore.

## 1.2.1

### UserRepository

The methods from the `UserProviderInterface` of Symfony have been moved to a
separate `UserProvider` implementation. Also, the `getUserInSystem` method
has been renamed to `findUserBySystem` and takes the system as an argument.

If you want to use the `Sulu` system you should inject the
`sulu_security.system` container parameter instead of hardcoding it.

## 1.2.0

### sulu_content_path
src/Sulu/Bundle/WebsiteBundle/Resources/config/services.xml
The twig function `sulu_content_path('/path')` now always returning the full-qualified-domain
`http://www.sulu.io/de/path`.

### Custom-Routes

The naming of the custom-routes with `type: portal` has changed. You can use now the configured name 
and pass the host and prefix in the parameter. The current parameter will be populated in the variable
`request.routeParameters`.

__before:__
```
{{ path(request.portalUrl ~'.'~ request.locale ~ '.website_search') }}
```

__after:__
```
{{ path('website_search', request.routeParameters) }}
```

### Admin

The navigation entry with the empty name wont be used in sulu anymore. It should be replaced by:

__before:__

```php
    $section = new NavigationItem('');
```

__after:__

```php
    $section = new NavigationItem('navigation.modules');
```

### Twig function `sulu_resolve_user`

This twig function returns now the user. To get the related contact use following code snippet:

```twig
{{ sulu_resolve_user(userId).contact.fullName }}
```

### Webspace validation

Webspaces which have unused localizations by portals will now be not valid and ignored. Remove this
localizations or add them to a portal.

### New security permission for cache
 
To be able to clear the cache the user need the permission LIVE in the
webspace context.

### Document-Manager

The Behaviors `TimestampBehavior` and `BlameBehavior` now save the values in the non-localized
properties. To keep the old behavior use the `LocalizedTimestampBehavior` and 
`LocalizedBlameBehavior` instead.

### Deprecated sulu:phpcr:init and sulu:webspace:init

The `sulu:phpcr:init` and `sulu:webspace:init` commands are now deprecated.
Use the `sulu:document:initialize` command instead.

### Definition of security contexts

The definition of security contexts in the `Admin` classes has changed. They
used to look like the following example:

```php
public function getSecurityContexts()
{
    return [
        'Sulu' => [
            'Media' => [
                'sulu.media.collections',
            ],
        ],
    ];
}
```

Now you should also pass the permission types that you want to enable in the
context:

```php
public function getSecurityContexts()
{
    return [
        'Sulu' => [
            'Media' => [
                'sulu.media.collections' => [
                    PermissionTypes::VIEW,
                    PermissionTypes::ADD,
                    PermissionTypes::EDIT,
                    PermissionTypes::DELETE,
                    PermissionTypes::SECURITY,
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ];
}
```

By default, we will enable the permission types `VIEW`, `ADD`, `EDIT`, `DELETE`
and `SECURITY` in your context.

### Page search index

The metadata for pages has changed. Run following command to update your search index

```bash
app/console massive:search:purge --all
app/console massive:search:reindex
```

### Media uploads

Write permissions for the webserver must be set on `web/uploads` instead of
`web/uploads/media` alone to support simple cache clearing.

### BlameSubscriber

The BlameBehavior has been moved from the DocumentManager component to the
Sulu Content component. Documents which implemented
`Sulu\Component\DocumentManager\Behavior\Audit\BlameBehavior` should now
implement `Sulu\Component\Content\Document\Behavior\BlameBehavior` instead.

### Contact Entity is required for User

When you create new `User` entities in your application it is required now
that this user has a `Contact` entity. The following SQL will return you
all users which have no contact entity. You need to update them manually.

```sql
SELECT * FROM se_users WHERE se_users.idContacts IS NULL 
```

### Admin Commands

The method `getCommands` on the Admin has been removed, because Symfony can
autodetect Commands in the `Command` directory of each bundle anyway. This only
affects you, if you have not followed the Symfony standards and located your
commands somewhere else.

### WebsiteRequestAnalyzer

The `Current`-part of all setters have been removed, because they have already
been removed from the getters. This only affects you if you have overridden the
`WebsiteRequestAnalyzer` and have called or overridden these methods.

### Databases

#### PHPCR

A new namespace and additional system nodes were added. To create them run the following command:

```bash
app/console sulu:document:initialize
```

#### ORM

The relational structure of categories, translations and users have changed. 
Use the following command to update:

```bash
app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

It might be possible that foreign key checks have to be disabled for this update.

### ContentNavigation & Navigation

The ContentNavigationItems & NavigationItems will be sorted by their position. If there is no position set, the item
will be placed behind all other items.

```php
$item = new ContentNavigationItem('content-navigation.entry');
$item->setPosition(10);
```

## 1.1.10

### Filter

Update the schema `app/console doctrine:schema:update --force` and run following SQL-Statement:
 
```sql
UPDATE re_conditions SET value = CONCAT('"', value, '"') WHERE value NOT LIKE '"%"';
INSERT INTO `re_operators` (`id`, `operator`, `type`, `inputType`) VALUES
    (16, 'and', 5, 'tags'),
    (17, 'or', 5, 'tags'),
    (18, '=', 6, 'auto-complete'),
    (19, '!=', 6, 'auto-complete');
INSERT INTO `re_operator_translations` (`id`, `name`, `locale`, `shortDescription`, `longDescription`, `idOperators`) VALUES
    (35, 'gleich', 'de', NULL, NULL, 18),
    (36, 'is', 'en', NULL, NULL, 18),
    (37, 'ungleich', 'de', NULL, NULL, 19),
    (38, 'is not', 'en', NULL, NULL, 19),
    (39, 'und', 'de', NULL, NULL, 16),
    (40, 'and', 'en', NULL, NULL, 16),
    (41, 'oder', 'de', NULL, NULL, 17),
    (42, 'or', 'en', NULL, NULL, 17);
```

Additionally the filter by country has changed. Run following SQL script to update your filter conditions:

```sql
UPDATE `re_conditions` SET `field` = 'countryId', `type` = 6, `value` = CONCAT('"', (SELECT `id` FROM `co_countries` WHERE `code` = REPLACE(`re_conditions`. `value`, '"', '') LIMIT 1), '"') WHERE `field` = 'countryCode' AND `operator` != 'LIKE';

DELETE FROM `re_filters` WHERE `re_filters`.`id` IN (SELECT `re_condition_groups`.`idFilters` FROM `re_condition_groups` LEFT JOIN `re_conditions` ON `re_condition_groups`.`id` = `re_conditions`.`idConditionGroups` WHERE `re_conditions`.`operator` = 'LIKE');
```

Filter with a "like" condition for country (account and contact) will be lost after the upgrade because there is no
functionality for that anymore.

## 1.1.2

### Reindex-Command & Date Content-Type

First remove the version node `201511240844` with following command:

```bash
app/console doctrine:phpcr:node:remove /jcr:versions/201511240844
```

Then run the migrate command (`app/console phpcr:migrations:migrate`) to remove translated properties with non locale
and upgrade date-values within blocks.

## 1.1.0

### IndexName decorators from MassiveSearchBundle

The names of the indexes in the system can now be altered using decorators. There
is also a `PrefixDecorator`, which can prefixes the index name with an installation
specific prefix, which can be set using the `massive_search.metadata.prefix`
parameter.

The configuration parameter `massive_search.localization_strategy` have been removed.

The indexes have to be rebuilt using the following command:

```bash
app/console massive:search:index:rebuild --purge
```

### List-Toobar

To enable a sticky behaviour take a look at the documentation <http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/bundles/admin/javascript-hooks/sticky-toolbar.html>

### Url Content-Type

The old upgrade for the url content-type don't upgrade properties in blocks. Rerun the migrate command to upgrade them.

```bash
app/console phpcr:migrations:migrate
```

### User locking

The locked toggler in the user tab of the contact section now sets the `locked`
field in the `se_users` table. Before this setting was written to the
`disabled` flag in the `co_contacts` table, which is removed now. If you have
used this field make sure to backup the data before applying the following
command:

```bash
app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

### Date Content-Type

The type of the date value in the database was wrong to update your existing data use following command:

```bash
app/console phpcr:migrations:migrate
```

### Media View Settings

The media collection thumbnailLarge view was removed from the media, 
to avoid an error, remove all `collectionEditListView` from the user settings table.

```sql
DELETE FROM `se_user_settings` WHERE `settingsKey` = 'collectionEditListView';
```
### Search

To index multiple fields (and `category_list` content-type) you have to add the attribute `type="array"` to the
`sulu.search.field` tag. The `tag_list` content-type has its own search-field type `tags`
(`<tag name="sulu.search.field" type="tags"/>`).

### Category Content-Type

The category content-type converts the selected ids into category data only for website rendering now. 

### System Collections

Remove the config `sulu_contact.form.avatar_collection` and note it you will need it in the sql statement below for the
placeholder `{old-avatar-collection}` (default value is `1`).

Update the database schema and then update the data-fixtures by running following sql statement.

```bash
app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

```sql
UPDATE me_collection_types SET collection_type_key='collection.default', name='Default' WHERE id=1;
INSERT INTO me_collection_types (id, name, collection_type_key) VALUES ('2', 'System Collections', 'collection.system');
```

The following sql statement moves the avatar images into the newly created system collections. To find the value for the
placeholder `{new-system-collection-id}` you can browse in the admin to the collection and note the `id` you find in the
url.

```sql
UPDATE me_media SET idCollections={new-system-collection-id} WHERE idCollections={old-avatar-collection};
```

### Search

The search mapping has to be changed, in particular the `index` tag. It is now
evaluated the same way as the other fields, so using `<index name="..."/>` will
now try to resolve the name of the index using a property from the given
object. If the old behavior is desired `<index value="..."/>` should be used
now.

Also the structure of the indexes has changed. Instead of one `page` index
containing all the pages this index is split into smaller ones after the scheme
`page_<webspace-key>`. This means that your own SearchController have to be
adapted. Additionally you have to rebuild your index, in order for these
changes to apply:

```bash
app/console massive:search:index:rebuild --purge
```

### Category
Category has now a default locale this has to set before use. You can use this sql statement after update your schema
(`app/console doctrine:schema:update --force`):

```sql
UPDATE ca_categories AS c SET default_locale = (SELECT locale FROM ca_category_translations WHERE idCategories = c.id LIMIT 1) WHERE default_locale = "";
```

### Websocket Component
The following Interfaces has new methods

Interface                                                             | Method                                                                  | Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
Sulu/Component/Websocket/MessageDispatcher/MessageHandlerInterface    | onClose(ConnectionInterface $conn, MessageHandlerContext $context)      | will be called when a connection is closed or lost.
Sulu/Component/Websocket/MessageDispatcher/MessageDispatcherInterface | onClose(ConnectionInterface $conn, ConnectionContextInterface $context) | will be called when a connection is closed or lost.

### Logo/Avatar in Contact-Section
Can now be deleted from collection view. For that the database has to be updated.

```bash
app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

### Infinite scroll
The infinite-scroll-extension got refactored. To initialize infinite-scroll on an element, use
"this.sandbox.infiniteScroll.initialize(selector, callback)" instead of "this.sandbox.infiniteScroll(selector, callback)"
now. To unbind an infinite-scroll handler, use "this.sandbox.infiniteScroll.destroy(selector)"

### URL-ContentType
The URL-ContentType can now handle schemas like http or https. For that you have to add the default scheme to the
database records by executing following SQL statement:

```sql
UPDATE co_urls AS url SET url.url = CONCAT('http://', url.url) WHERE url.url NOT LIKE 'http://%';
```

To updated you content pages and snippets simply run:

```bash
app/console phpcr:migrations:migrate
```

Consider that the URL is now stored including the scheme (http://, ftp://, and so on), and therefore must not be
appended in the Twig template anymore.

### Media Metadata
Copyright field is now available in the metadata of medias. Therefore you have to update you database:

```bash
app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

### XML-Templates
Blocks now supports `minOccurs="0"` and `maxOccurs > 127`. For that the validation was improved and for both negative
values wont be supported anymore.

### Preview
The preview can now handle attributes and nested properties. To differentiate blocks and nested properties, it is now
necessary to add the property `typeof="collection"` to the root of a block `<div>` and 
`typeof="block" rel="name of block property"` to each child - see example.

__block:__

```twig
<div class="row" property="block" typeof="collection">
    {% for block in content.block %}
        <div rel="block" typeof="block">
            <h1 property="title">{{ block.title }}</h1>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
</div>
```

__nested properties:__

```twig
<div property="is_winter">
    {% if content.is_winter %}
        <div property="article">{{ content.winter_article }}</div>
    {% endif %}
</div>
```

### Content Type Export Interface added

All default content type implement the new `ContentTypeExportInterface`.  
Content types which were exportable need to implement this interface and tag for which export `format` they are available.  

``` xml
        <service id="client_website.content.type.checkbox" class="%client_website.content.type.checkbox.class%">
            <tag name="sulu.content.type" alias="custom_checkbox"/>
            <tag name="sulu.content.export" format="1.2.xliff" translate="false" />
        </service>
```

### Extensions constructor changed

Extensions can also be exportable for this they need to implement the new `ExportExtensionInterface`.  
In the sulu excerpt extension the constructor changed, if you extend or overwrite this extension you maybe need to add
the `sulu_content.export.manager` service to the constructor.

### ApiCategory
The function `getTranslation` was removed.  This avoid a INSERT SQL Exception when a serialization of categories
(without translation) is called in the same request.

### Registering JS-Routes
When registering backbone-routes now - instead of directly starting the corresponding component via 'this.html' - make your callback returning the component.
So for example the following:
``` js
sandbox.mvc.routes.push({
    route: 'contacts/accounts/edit::id/:content',
    callback: function(id) {
        this.html('<div data-aura-component="accounts/edit@sulucontact" data-aura-id="' + id + '"/>');
    }
});
```
becomes:
``` js
sandbox.mvc.routes.push({
    route: 'contacts/accounts/edit::id/:content',
    callback: function(id) {
        return '<div data-aura-component="accounts/edit@sulucontact" data-aura-id="' + id + '"/>';
    }
});
```

### Media Content Selection Type attribute changed

When you use the sulu media selection in your custom bundle you need to change the `data-type`.

**Before:**

``` html
<div id="{{ id|raw }}"
    ...
    data-type="mediaSelection"
    data-aura-component="media-selection@sulumedia"
    ...
</div>
```

**After:**
``` html
<div id="{{ id|raw }}"
    ...
    data-type="media-selection"
    data-aura-component="media-selection@sulumedia"
    ...
</div>
```

### Header
The header got a complete redesign, the breadcrumb and bottom-content are not available anymore. Also the event `header.set-toolbar` got marked as deprecated. The recommended way to start a sulu-header is via the header-hook of a view-component.

Some properties in the header-hook have changed, some are new, some not supported anymore. For a complete overview on the current properties in the header-hook see the documentation: http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/bundles/admin/javascript-hooks/index.html

The major work when upgrading to the new header is to change the button-templates to sulu-buttons. Before you had to pass a template like e.g. 'default', which initialized a set of buttons, now each button is passed explicitly which gives you more flexibility. Lets have a look at an example:

**Before:**
```js
header: {
    tabs: {
        url: '/admin/content-navigations?alias=category'
    },
    toolbar: {
        template: 'default'
    }
}
```

**After:**
```js
header: {
    tabs: {
        url: '/admin/content-navigations?alias=category'
    },
    toolbar: {
        buttons: {
            save: {},
            settings: {
                options: {
                    dropdownItems: {
                        delete: {}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you are using the `default` template in the header and now change to the sulu-buttons `save` and `delete` the emitted events changed.

| **Before**                    | **After**                    |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `sulu.header.toolbar.save`    | `sulu.toolbar.save`          |
| `sulu.header.toolbar.delete`  | `sulu.toolbar.delete`        |

Also the call for `disable`, `enable` and `loading` state of the `save` button has changed:

**Before:**

``` js
this.sandbox.emit('sulu.header.toolbar.state.change', 'edit', false); // enable
this.sandbox.emit('sulu.header.toolbar.state.change', 'edit', true, true); // disabled
this.sandbox.emit('sulu.header.toolbar.item.loading', 'save-button'); // loading 
```

**After:**

``` js
this.sandbox.emit('sulu.header.toolbar.item.enable', 'save', false); // enable
this.sandbox.emit('sulu.header.toolbar.item.disable', 'save', true); // disabled
this.sandbox.emit('sulu.header.toolbar.item.loading', 'save'); // loading 
```

#### Tabs
The tabs can be configured with the 'url', 'data' and 'container' option. The option 'fullControll' got removed. You can get the same effect by passing data with no 'component'-property.
For a complete overview on the current properties in the header-hook see the documentation: http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/bundles/admin/javascript-hooks/index.html

#### Toolbar
The language-changer can be configured as it was. 'Template' and 'parentTemplate' in contrast are not supported anymore. Instead you pass an array of sulu-buttons.
Moreover the format of the buttons itself changed: https://github.com/massiveart/husky/blob/f9b3abeb547553c9c031710f1f98d0288b08ca9c/UPGRADE.md
Have a look at the documentation: http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/bundles/admin/javascript-hooks/header.html

#### Language changer
The interface of the language-changer in the header hook stayed the same, however the emitted event changed from `sulu.header.toolbar.language-changed` to `sulu.header.language-changed`. A callback to this event recieves an object with an `id`- and a `title`-property.

**Before:**
```js
this.sandbox.on('sulu.header.toolbar.language-changed', this.languageChanged.bind(this));
// ...
languageChanged: function(locale) {
    this.options.locale = locale;
}
```

**After:**
```js
this.sandbox.on('sulu.header.language-changed', this.languageChanged.bind(this));
// ...
languageChanged: function(locale) {
    this.options.locale = locale.id;
}
```

#### Sulu-buttons
Buttons for toolbars get specified in an aura-extension (`sandbox.sulu.buttons` and `sandbox.sulu.buttons.dropdownItems`). Therfore each bundle can add their own buttons to the pool. The toolbar in the header fetches its buttons from this pool.
Have a look at the documentation: http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/bundles/admin/sulu-buttons.html

#### List-toolbar
The 'inHeader' option got removed and is not supported anymore. `Sulu.buttons` are used internally and can be passed via the template which is recommended instead of using string templates.

#### Content-Types

Interface of Method has changed.

Old                                | New
-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
public function getDefaultParams() | public function getDefaultParams(PropertyInterface $property = null)

### Modified listbuilder to work with expressions

The listbuilder uses now expressions to build the query. In course of these changes some default values have been
removed from some methodes of the `AbstractListBuilder` because of unclear meaning / effect. Changed function parameters:

- where (conjunction removed)
- between (conjunction removed)

### Security

The security now requires its own phpcr namespace for storing security related information. To register this namespace
execute the following command.

```bash
app/console sulu:phpcr:init
```

### Enabled listbuilder to have multiple sort fields

It's now possible to have multiple sort fields by calling `sort()`. It's previous behavior was to always reset the sort
field, instead of adding a new one. Check if you haven't applied `sort()` multiple times to a listbuilder with the
purpose of overriding its previous sort field.

### Datagrid style upgrade

- Deleted options: fullwidth, stickyHeader, rowClickSelect
- The list-view with no margin was removed from the design. The view is still of width: 'max' but now with spacing on the left and right.
- For routing from a list to the edit the new option actionCallback should be used. For other actions like displaying additional information in the sidebar there exists a new option clickCallback. These two callbacks alow the component to adapt its style depending on if there is an action or not. For special cases there is still the item.click event.

### Filter conjunction field is nullable

```bash
app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

## 1.0.8

The `sulu_meta_seo` twig method does not render the canonical tag for shadow pages. Therefore this method is deprecated
and will be removed with Sulu 1.2. Use the new `sulu_seo` method instead. This method will also render the title, so
there is no need for the title block as it has been in the Sulu standard edition anymore.

## 1.0.6

### Configuration

The syntax of `sulu_core.locales` configuration has changed. It has to be defined with a translation. Additional the
translations of backend (currently only en/de) and a fallback locale can be configured.

```
sulu_core:
    locales:
        de: Deutsch
        en: English
    fallback_locale: 'en'
    translations: ['de', 'en']
```

## 1.0.4

### External link

If you have external-link pages created before 1.0.0 you should run the following command to fix them.
 
```
app/console phpcr:migrations:migrate
```

### Shadow-Pages

Filter values will now be copied from shadow-base locale to shadowed locale. Upgrade your data with following command:

```bash
app/console phpcr:migrations:migrate
```

### User serialization

The groups of the JMSSerializer for the users have changed. Make sure to include the group `fullUser` in the
`SerializationContext` if you are missing some fields in the serialized User.

## 1.0.0

### User / Role management changed

Service `sulu_security.role_repository` changed to `sulu.repository.role`.
Service `sulu_security.user_repository` should be avoided. Use `sulu.repository.user` instead.

### Snippets

Snippet state has been removed and set default to published. Therefor all snippets has to be set to published by this
running this command for each <locale>:

```bash
app/console doctrine:phpcr:nodes:update --query="SELECT * FROM [nt:unstructured] WHERE [jcr:mixinTypes] = 'sulu:snippet'" --apply-closure="\$node->setProperty('i18n:<locale>-state', 2);"
```

### Page-Templates

1. The tag `sulu.rlp` is now mandatory for page templates.
2. Page templates will now be filtered: only implemented templates in the theme will be displayed in the dropdown.
 
To find pages with not implemented templates run following command:

```bash
app/console sulu:content:validate <webspace-key>
```

To fix that pages, you could implement the template in the theme or save the pages with an other template over ui.

### Webspaces

1. The default-template config moved from global configuration to webspace config. For that it is needed to add this config to each webspace. 
2. The excluded xml tag has been removed from the webspace configuration file, so you have to remove this tag from all these files.

After that your webspace theme config should look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<webspace xmlns="http://schemas.sulu.io/webspace/webspace"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://schemas.sulu.io/webspace/webspace http://schemas.sulu.io/webspace/webspace-1.0.xsd">

...

    <theme>
        <key>default</key>
        <default-templates>
            <default-template type="page">default</default-template>
            <default-template type="homepage">overview</default-template>
        </default-templates>
    </theme>

...

</webspace>
```

Also remove the following default-template config for page and homepage from the file `app/config/config.yml`:

```yml
sulu_core:
    content:
        structure:
            default_type:
                snippet: "default"
-               page: "default"
-               homepage: "overview"
```

## 1.0.0-RC3

### Document Manager

The new Document Manager have been introduced, which means that a few files need to be updated.

There is a new namespace `Sulu\Component\Content\Compat`, which acts as a compatability layer. So all the controllers
extending the `DefaultController` and adapting its `indexAction` need to change a use statement from
`Sulu\Component\Content\StructureInterface` to `Sulu\Component\Content\Compat\StructureInterface`.

There are also some changes in the database, so you have to run the migrations:

```
app/console phpcr:migrations:migrate
```

In case the system still contains old data from the internal links content type you also have to run the upgrade command
again.

```
app/console sulu:upgrade:rc3:internal-links
```

The following classes have been moved, and every reference to them has to be updated:

Old name                                                 | New name

Sulu\Component\Content\Section\StructureType             | Sulu\Component\Content\Compat\StructureType

### Upgrade commands

All the upgrade commands have been removed, since they are not of any use for
future versions of Sulu. The only exception is the
`sulu:upgrade:0.9.0:resource-locator` command, which has been renamed to
`sulu:content:resource-locator:maintain`.

### Contact management changed

Service `sulu_contact.contact_repository` changed to `sulu.repository.contact`.

| Removed methods                                                           | Use instead                                                               |

## 1.0.0-RC2

### Twig-Extensions

Following Twig-Functions has changed the name (new prefix for sulu functions):

| Before                    | Now                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|

| `snippet_load`            | `sulu_snippet_load`           |

To automatically update this name you can run the following script. If your themes are not in the ClientWebsiteBundle
you have to change the folder in the second line.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
TWIGS=($(find ./src/Client/Bundle/WebsiteBundle/Resources/themes -type f -iname "*.twig"))

NAMES[9]="content_load_parent"
NAMES[10]="get_media_url"
NAMES[11]="meta_alternate"
NAMES[12]="meta_seo"

do
    for name in ${NAMES[*]}
    do
        sed -i '' -e "s/$name/sulu_$name/g" $twig
    done
done
```

After running this script please check the changed files for conflicts and wrong replaces! 

### Website Navigation

Children of pages with the state "test" or pages which have the desired navigaiton context not assigned won't be moved
up in the hierarchy, instead they won't show up in the navigation at all.

## 1.0.0-RC1

### Security Roles
The identifiers in the acl_security_identities should be rename from SULU_ROLE_* to ROLE_SULU_*. This SQL snippet should 
do the job for you, you should adapt it to fit your needs:

UPDATE `acl_security_identities` SET `identifier` = REPLACE(`identifier`, 'SULU_ROLE_', 'ROLE_SULU_');

### Texteditor

The params for the texteditor content type where changed.

| Before                                        | Now                                                                                                           |

| `<param name="scripts" value="true" />`       | `<param name="extra_allowed_content" value="img(*)[*]; span(*)[*]; div(*)[*]; iframe(*)[*]; script(*)[*]" />` |


## 0.18.0

## Search index rebuild

Old data in search index can cause problems. You should clear the folder `app/data` and rebuild the index.
 
```bash
rm -rf app/data/*
app/console massive:search:index:rebuild
```

### Search adapter name changed

Adapter name changed e.g. from `massive_search_adapter.<adaptername>` to just `<adaptername>` in
configuration.

### Search index name changed

Pages and snippets are now indexed in separate indexes for pages and snippets.
Replace all instances of `->index('content')` with `->indexes(array('page',
'snippet')`.

### Search searches non-published pages by default

Pages which are "Test" are no longer indexed. If you require only
"published" pages modify your search query to start with: `state:published AND `
and escape the quotes:

```php
$hits = $searchManager
    ->createSearch(sprintf('state:published AND "%s"', str_replace('"', '\\"', $query)))
    ->locale($locale)
    ->index('page')
    ->execute();
```

### PHPCR: Doctrine-Dbal

The structure of data has changed. Run following command:

```bash
app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

### Smart content tag operator

The default operator for tags is now changed to OR. So you have to update with the following command,
because the previous default operator was AND.

```bash
app/console sulu:upgrade:0.18.0:smart-content-operator tag and
```

### Media Format Cache Public Folder

If you use the `sulu_media.format_cache.public_folder` parameter, 
the following configuration update need to be done,
because the parameter does not longer exists:

``` yml
sulu_media:
    format_cache:
        public_folder: 'public' # delete this line
        path: %kernel.root_dir%/../public/uploads/media # add this new configuration
```

### Admin

The `Sulu` prefix from all `ContentNavigationProviders` and `Admin` classes has
been removed. You have to change these names in all usages of this classes in
your own code.

### Media image converter commands

The image converter commands are now handled via service container tags. No need for the 
`sulu_media.image.command.prefix` anymore. If you have created your own command, you have to
tag your image converter command service with `sulu_media.image.command`.

Before:

```xml
<services>
    <service id="%sulu_media.image.command.prefix%blur" class="%acme.image.command.blur.class%" />
</services>
```

Change to:

```xml
<services>
    <service id="acme.image.command.blur" class="%acme.image.command.blur.class%">
        <tag name="sulu_media.image.command" alias="resize" />
    </service>
</services>
```

### Media preview urls

The thumbnail url will only be generated for supported mime-types. Otherwise it returns a zero length array.

To be sure that it is possible to generate a preview image you should check if the thumbnail url isset:

```twig
{% if media.thumbnails['200x200'] is defined %}
<img src="{{ media.thumbnails['200x200'] }}"/>
{% endif %}
```

### Error templates

Variables of exception template `ClientWebsiteBundle:error404.html.twig` has changed.

* `status_code`: response code 
* `status_text`: response text
* `exception`: whole exception object
* `currentContent`: content which was rendered before exception was thrown

Especially for 404 exception the `path` variable has been removed.

Before:
```twig
<p>The path "<em>{{ path }}</em>" does not exist.</p>
```

After:
```twig
<p>The path "<em>{{ request.resourceLocator }}</em>" does not exist.</p>
```

The behaviour of the errors has changed. In dev mode no custom error pages appears.
To see them you have to open following url:

```
{portal-prefix}/_error/{status_code}
sulu.lo/de/_error/500
```

More Information can be found in [sulu-docs](http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/cookbook/custom-error-page.html).

To keep the backward compatibility you have to add following lines to your webspace configuration:

```xml
<webspace>
    ...
    
    <theme>
        ...
        
        <error-templates>
            <error-template code="404">ClientWebsiteBundle:views:error404.html.twig</error-template>
            <error-template default="true">ClientWebsiteBundle:views:error.html.twig</error-template>
        </error-templates>
    </theme>
    
    ...
</webspace>
```

### Twig Templates

If a page has no url for a specific locale, it returns now the resource-locator to the index page (`'/'`) instead of a
empty string (`''`).
 
__Before:__
```
urls = array(
    'de' => '/ueber-uns',
    'en' => '/about-us',
    'es' => ''
);
```

__After:__
```
urls = array(
    'de' => '/ueber-uns',
    'en' => '/about-us',
    'es' => '/'
);
```

### Util

The `Sulu\Component\Util\UuidUtils` has been removed. Use the `Phpcr\Utils\UuidHelper` instead.

## 0.17.0

### Media

Fill up the database column `me_collection_meta.locale` with the translated language like: `de` or `en`. If you
know you have only added collections in only one language you can use following sql statement:

```sql
UPDATE `me_collection_meta` SET `locale` = 'de';
```

Due to this it is possible that one collection has multiple metadata for one language. You have to remove this
duplicates by hand. For example one collection should have only one meta for the language `de`.

The collection and media has now a specific field to indicate which meta is default. For this run following commands.

```bash
app/console sulu:upgrade:0.17.0:collections
app/console sulu:upgrade:0.17.0:media
```

### Content navigation

The interfaces for the content navigation have been changed, so you have to
apply these changes if you have used a content navigation in your bundle.

Basically you can delete the `NavigationController` delivering the content
navigation items together with its routes. It's now common to suffix the
classes providing content navigation items with `ContentNavigationProvider`.

These classes have to implement the `ContentNavigationProviderInterface` and be
registered as services as described in the
[documentation](http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/cookbook/using-the-tab-navigation.html).

Consider that the URLs for the retrieval of the content navigation items have
changed to `/admin/content-navigations?alias=your-alias` and have to be updated
in your javascript components.

### Contact and Account Security

The security checks are now also applied to contacts and accounts, make sure
that the users you want to have access have the correct permissions.

### Content

Behaviour of internal links has changed. It returns the link title for navigation/smartcontent/internal-link.

### Media Types

The media types are now set by wildcard check and need to be updated,
by running the following command: `sulu:media:type:update`.

### Media API Object

The `versions` attribute of the media API object changed from [array to object list](https://github.com/sulu-io/docs/pull/14/files).

### Contact

CRM-Components moved to a new bundle. If you enable the new Bundle everything should work as before.

BC-Breaks are:

 * AccountCategory replaced with standard Categories here is a migration needed
 
For a database upgrade you have to do following steps:

* The Account has no `type` anymore. This column has to be removed from `co_accounts` table.
* The table `co_account_categories` has to be removed manually.
* The table `co_terms_of_delivery` has to be removed manually.
* The table `co_terms_of_payment` has to be removed manually.
* `app/console doctrine:schema:update --force`

### Security

The names of some classes have changed like shown in the following table:

Old name                                                          | New name
------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------
Sulu\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Entity\RoleInterface                   | Sulu\Component\Security\Authentication\RoleInterface
Sulu\Component\Security\UserInterface                             | Sulu\Component\Security\Authentication\UserInterface
Sulu\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Factory\UserRepositoryFactoryInterface | Sulu\Component\Security\Authentication\UserRepositoryFactoryInterface
Sulu\Component\Security\UserRepositoryInterface                   | Sulu\Component\Security\Authentication\UserRepositoryInterface
Sulu\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Permission\SecurityCheckerInterface    | Sulu\Component\Security\Authorization\SecurityCheckerInterface

If you have used any of these interfaces you have to update them.

## 0.16.0

### Content Types

Time content types returns now standardized values (hh:mm:ss) and can handle this as localized string in the input
field.

For content you can upgrade the pages with:

```bash
app/console sulu:upgrade:0.16.0:time
```

In the website you should change the output if time to your format.

If you use the field in another component you should upgrade your api that it returns time values in format (hh:mm:ss).

### Security

Database has changed: User has now a unique email address. Run following command:

```bash
app/console doctrine:schema:update --force
```

## 0.15.0

### Sulu Locales
The Sulu Locales are not hardcoded anymore, but configured in the `app/config/config.yml` file:

```yml
sulu_core:
    locales: ["de","en"]
```

You have to add the locales to your configuration, otherwise Sulu will stop working.

### Internal Links

The internal representation of the internal links have changed, you have to run the following command to convert them:

```bash
app/console sulu:upgrade:0.15.0:internal-links
```

### Content Types

PropertyParameter are now able to hold metadata. Therefore the Interface has changed. Please check all your
ContentTypes which uses params.

__Before:__

DefaultParams:

```php
array(
    'name' => 'value',
    ...
)
```
Access in Twig:

```twig
{{ params.name }}
```

__After:__

```php
array(
    'name' => new PropertyParameter('name', 'string', 'value', array()),
    ...
)
```
Access in Twig:

```twig
As String:
{{ params.name }}

As Array or boolean:
{{ params.name.value }}

Get translated title:
{{ params.name.getTitle('de') }}
```

__Optional:__

Metadata under properties in template:

```xml
<property name="smart_content" type="smart_content">
    <params>
        <param name="display_as" type="collection">
            <param name="two">
                <meta>
                    <title lang="de">Zwei Spalten</title>
                    <title lang="en">Two columns</title>

                    <info_text lang="de">Die Seiten werden in zwei Spalten dargestellt</info_text>
                    <info_text lang="en">The pages would be displayed in two columns</info_text>
                </meta>
            </param>
        </param>
    </params>
</property>
```

### Websocket Component

Websocket start command changed to `app/console sulu:websocket:run`. If you use xdebug on your server please start
websockets with `app/console sulu:websocket:run -e prod`.

Default behavior is that websocket turned of for preview, if you want to use it turn it on in the
`app/config/admin/config.yml` under:

```yml
 sulu_content:
     preview:
         mode: auto       # possibilities [auto, on_request, off]
         websocket: false # use websockets for preview, if true it tries to connect to websocket server,
                          # if that fails it uses ajax as a fallback
         delay: 300       # used for the delayed send of changes, lesser delay are more request but less latency
```

### HTTP Cache

The HTTP cache integration has been refactored. The following configuration
must be **removed**:

````yaml
sulu_core:
    # ...
    http_cache:
        type: symfonyHttpCache
````

The Symfony HTTP cache is enabled by default now, so there is no need to do
anything else. See the [HTTP cache
documentation](http://sulu.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/bundles/http_cache.html)
for more information.

### Renamed RequestAnalyzerInterface methods

The text "Current" has been removed from all of the request analyzer methods.
If you used the request analyzer service then you will probably need to update
your code, see: https://github.com/sulu-cmf/sulu/pull/749/files#diff-23

## 0.14.0

* Role name is now unique
  * check roles and give them unique names
* Apply all permissions correctly, otherwise users won't be able to work on snippets, categories or tags anymore

## 0.13.0

* Remove `/cmf/<webspace>/temp` from repository
  * run `app/console doctrine:phpcr:node:remove /cmf/<webspace>/temp` foreach webspace

## 0.12.0

* Permissions have to be correct now, because they are applied
  * otherwise add a permission value of 120 for `sulu.security.roles`,
    `sulu.security.groups` and `sulu.security.users` to one user to change
    the settings in the UI
  * also check for the correct value in the `locale`-column of the `se_user_roles`-table
    * value has to be a json-string (e.g. `["en", "de"]`)
* Snippet content type defaults to all snippet types available instead of the
  default one
  * Explicitly define a snippet type in the parameters if this is not desired
